# The DrK (De-randomizing Kernel ASLR) attack
DrK is an attack that breaks kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR)
by exploiting TLB and decoded i-cache side channel. To reliably exploit the
side channels, the DrK attack took advantage of
Intel TSX (Transactional Synchronization eXtension).
One surprising behavior of TSX, which is essentially
the root cause of this security loophole, is that it aborts a
transaction without notifying the underlying kernel even when the
transaction fails due to a critical error, such as a page fault or an
access violation, which traditionally requires kernel intervention.
DrK turns this property into a precise timing channel that can
determine the mapping status (i.e., mapped versus unmapped) and
execution status (i.e., executable versus non-executable) of the privileged
kernel address space. Since such behavior is on the hardware level,
DrK is universally applicable to all OSes, even in
virtualized environments, and generates no visible footprint, making
it difficult to detect in practice.
Therefore, DrK can break
the KASLR of all major OSes (i.e., Windows, Linux, and OS X)
with near-perfect accuracy in under a second.
